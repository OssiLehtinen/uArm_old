# uArm
Code snippets related to the uArm Swift Pro robotic arm

Note: For using the laser stuff, you also need Richarg GastHaagen's original uArmRobot library from:
https://github.com/AnykeyNL/uArmProPython

Note #2: The svgo and convert binaries are external to Python. Meaning, you need to install imagemagick and node.js on your system (e.g., sudo apt-get install imagemagick npm) and the svgo command for node.js (npg install -g svgo). These were tested on Kubuntu Linux 16.04. Not sure if they can be made to work on Windows. At least the temp_path of uArmLaserRobot needs to be changed.

Please, be careful with the laser. Don't blind yourself or burn your house down :)

If you create something cool with these functions, please show me too :) Primarily I'm just curious, and also seeing other people's work might give ideas on how to improve the code. So, don't hesitate to drop me an email: ossi.lehtinen@gmail.com
